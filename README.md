# LAG
Lexical Analyzer Generator

Given a list of tokens, this program will generate a C++ Lexical Analyzer class. 
The Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) that drives the Lexical Analyzer is generated by first creating a 
Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) using Thompson's Construction Algorithm 
then converting that NFA to a DFA using Powerset Construction.

Refer to this [repo](https://github.com/kmdiogo/LAG-Driver) to see how to use the generated class in another application

Run a WebAssembly compiled version of this program on my [online portfolio](https://kmdiogo.github.io/#/LAG)
