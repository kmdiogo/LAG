[ or [^
] or -]

How do I handle for example: stmtList -> stmt stmtList


use vector of triples to represent parse tree
(node, left, right) left and right are indexes to the node


make enumeration for Regex Node Type
-can be a single character, class, concat node, selection node, star node, question node, or node
- two integers: if base case: represents character or class.

to help with NFA:
- add first NFA nodes, last NFA Nodes to tree
