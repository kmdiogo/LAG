--- PARSER ---
- How do I handle for example: stmtList -> stmt stmtList

- use vector of triples to represent parse tree
(node, left, right) left and right are indexes to the node

make enumeration for Parse Tree Node Type
- can be a single character, class, concat node, selection node, star node, question node, or union node
- two integers: if base case: represents character or class.
--------------

--- NFA ---
to help with NFA:
- add first NFA node and last NFA Node to each Parse Tree Node
- remember first and last as you post-order traverse the tree (left-right-root)
